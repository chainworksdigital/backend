## Applications of Various welding processes

Forge welding: It is used in olden days for joining metals as a lap and butt joint.

Shielded Metal arc welding is used for welding all ferrous and non-ferrous metals using consumable stick electrodes,

Carbon arc welding is used for welding all ferrous and non-ferrous metals using carbon electrodes and separate filler metal. But this is a slow welding process and so not used now-a-days

Submerged arc welding is used for welding ferrous metals, thicker plates and for more production.
$\mathrm{Co}_{2}$ Welding (Gas Metal Arc Welding) is used for welding ferrous metals using continuously fed filler wire and shielding the weld metal and the arc by carbon-dioxide gas.

TIG welding (Gas Tungsten Arc Welding) Is used for welding ferrous metals, stainless steel, aluminium and thin sheet metal welding

Atomic hydrogen welding is used for welding all ferrous and non-ferrous metals and the arc has a higher temperature than other arc welding processes.

Electro slag welding is used for welding very thick steel plates in one pass using the resistance property of the flux material

Plasma arc welding: The arc has a very deep penetrating ability into the metals welded and also the fusion is taking place in a very narrow zone of the joint.

Spot welding is used for welding thin sheet metal as a lap joint in small spots by using the resistance property of the metals being welded.

Seam welding is used for welding thin sheets similar to spot welding. But the adjacent weld spots will be overlapping each other to get a continuous weld seam.

Projection welding is used to weld two plates one over the other on their surfaces instead of the edges by making projection on one plate and pressing it over the other flat surface. Each projection acts as a spot weld during welding.

Butt welding is used to join the ends of two heavy section rods/blocks together to lengthen it using the resistance property of the rods under contact.

Flash butt welding is used o join heavy sections of rods/blocks similar to butt welding except that arc flashes are produced at the joining ends to melt them before applying heavy pressure to join them.

Oxy -acetylene welding is used to join different ferrous and non ferrous metals, generally of 3 mm thickness and below.

Oxy-other fuel gases welding: Fuel gases like hydrogen, coal gas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) are used along with oxygen to get a flame and melt the base metal and filler rod. Since the temperature of these flames are lower than the oxy-acetylene flame, these welding are used to weld metals where less heat input is required

Air-acetylene gas welding is used for soldering, heating the job etc.

Induction welding is used to weld parts that are heated by electrical induction coils like brazing of tool tips to the shank, joining flat rings, etc.

Thermite welding is used for joining thick, heavy, irregularly shaped rods, like rails, etc using chemical heating process.

Friction welding is used to join the ends of large diameter shafts, etc., by generating the required heat using the friction between their ends in contact with each other by rotating one rod against the other rod.



## CG \& M

## Different process of metal joining methods: Bolting, riveting, soldering, brazing and seaming

Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to

- state the situations in which bolts and nuts are used
- state the advantages of using bolts and nuts
- identify the different types of bolts
- state the applications of the different types of bolts
- state the situations in which studs are used.

Bolts and nuts (Fig 1)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_03_07_bfdfb33c8fd9dd5542bcg-1.jpg?height=701&width=860&top_left_y=809&top_left_x=187)

These are generally used to clamp two parts together.
When bolts and nuts are used, if the thread is stripped, a new bolt and nut can be used. But in the case of a screw directly fitted in the component, when threads are damaged, the component may need extensive repair or replacement.
Depending on the type of application, different types of bolts are used.

Bolts with clearance hole (Fig 2)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_03_07_bfdfb33c8fd9dd5542bcg-1.jpg?height=546&width=863&top_left_y=1937&top_left_x=185)

This is the most common type of fastening arrangement using bolts. The size of the hole is slightly larger than the bolt (Clearance hole).

Slight misalignment in the matching hole will not affect the assembly.
Body fit bolt (Fig 3)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_03_07_bfdfb33c8fd9dd5542bcg-1.jpg?height=721&width=854&top_left_y=919&top_left_x=1115)

This type of bolt assembly is used when the relative movement between the work pieces has to be prevented. The diameter of the threaded portion is slightly smaller than the shank diameter of the bolt.

The bolt shank and the hole are accurately machined for achieving perfect mating.

## Anti-fatigue bolt (Fig 4)

Fig 4

ANTI-FATIGUE BOLT

This type of bolt is used when the assembly is subjected to alternating load conditions continuously. Connecting rod with big ends in engine assembly are examples of this application.

The shank diameter is in contact with the hole in a few places and other portions are relieved to give clearances.

## Studs (Fig 5)

Studs are used in assemblies which are to be separated frequently.

When excessively tightened, the variation in the thread pitch allows the fine thread or nut end to strip. This prevents damage to the casting.

## Rivet joints

Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to

- state the purpose of rivets
- identify the different types of rivets
- name the different types of riveted joints
- name the materials from which rivets are made.

Rivets are used to join together two or more sheets of metal permanently. In sheet metal work riveting is done where;

- brazing is not suitable,
- the structure changes owing to welding heat,
- the distortion due to welding cannot be easily removed etc.
Specification of rivets: Rivets are specified by their length, material, size and shape of head.
Rivets: There are various kinds of rivets as shown in Fig 1. Snap head rivets, countersink rivets and thin bevel head rivets are widely used in sheet metal work.
The materials used for rivets are mild steel, copper yellow brass, aluminium and heir alloys.
The length of the rivets ' L ' is indicated by the shank length. (Fig 1)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_03_07_bfdfb33c8fd9dd5542bcg-2.jpg?height=880&width=849&top_left_y=1813&top_left_x=92)

Rivet joints (Fig 2): Rivet joints are classified as lap joints and butt joints.

In the case of butt joints, a plate called a butt strap is used.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_03_07_bfdfb33c8fd9dd5542bcg-2.jpg?height=1417&width=849&top_left_y=1273&top_left_x=1020)

## Soldering

Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to

- define 'soldering'
- state the different types of soldering processes.

Soldering method: There are different methods of joining metallic sheets. Soldering is one of them.

Soldering is the process by which metals are joined with the help of another alloy called solder without heating the base metal to be joined. The melting point of the solder is lower than that of the materials being joined.

The molten solder wets the base material which helps in binding the base metal to form a joint.
Soldering should not be done on joints subjected to heat and vibration and where more strength is required.

Soldering can be classified as soft soldering and hard soldering. Hard soldering is further divided as (a) brazing (b) sliver brazing.

The process of joining metals using tin and lead as a soldering alloy which melts below $420^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is known as soft soldering.

The process of joining metals using copper. zinc and tin alloy as filler material in which the base metal is heated above $420^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ below $850^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is called brazing.

Silver brazing is similar to brazing except that the filler material used is a silver-copper alloy and the flux used is also different.

Brazing: Brazing is a metal joining process which is done at a temperature of above $450^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ as compared to soldering which is done at below $450^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
So brazing is a process in which the following steps are followed.

- Clean the area of the joint thoroughly by wire brushing, emerging and by chemical solutions for removing oil, grease, paints etc.
- Fit the joints tightly using proper clamping. (Maximum gap permitted between the two joining surfaces is only 0.08 mm )
- Apply the flux in paste form (for brazing iron and steel a mixture of $75 \%$ borax powder with $25 \%$ boric acid (liquid form) to form a paste is used). Usually the brazing flux contains chlorides, fluorides, borax, borates, fluoroborates, boric acid, wetting agents and water. So suitable flux combination is selected based on metal being used.
Brazing is employed where a ductile joints is required.
Brazing filler rods/ metals melt at temperature from $860^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $950^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and are used to braze iron and its alloys.
Brazing fluxes: Fused borax is the general purpose flux for most metals.

It is applied on the joint in the form of a paste made by mixing up with water.

If brazing is to be done at a lower temperature, fluorides of alkali materials are commonly used. These fluxes will remove refractory oxides of aluminium, chromium, silicon and beryllium.

## Various methods of brazing

Torch brazing: The base metal is heated to the required temperature by the application of the oxy-acetylene flame. (Fig 1)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_03_07_bfdfb33c8fd9dd5542bcg-3.jpg?height=663&width=866&top_left_y=888&top_left_x=1115)

## Advantages of brazing

The completed joint requires little or no finishing.
The relatively low temperature at which the joint made minimizes distortion.
There is no flash or weld spatter.
The brazing technique does not require as much skill as the technique for fusion welding.

The process can be easily mechanised.
The process is economical owing to the above advantages.

## Disadvantages of brazing

If the joint is exposed to corrosive media, the filler metal used may not have the required corrosive resistance.
All the brazing alloys loose strength at an elevated temperature
The colour of the brazing alloy which ranges from silver white to copper red may not match the base metal very closely.

## Seaming and Machine

Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to

- explain the construction of the seam closing machine
- identify the parts of the seam closing machine.

Grooved seam can also be closed or locked mechanically by means of the seam closing machine. This machine is also called "Seaming machine"

Parts shown in Fig 1 are Body, Arm, Pressure roller, Carriage, Crank handle, Latch and Crank rack.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_03_07_bfdfb33c8fd9dd5542bcg-4.jpg?height=627&width=767&top_left_y=663&top_left_x=99)

Horn: It contains grooves of various widths on throughout the length as shown in Fig 2.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_03_07_bfdfb33c8fd9dd5542bcg-4.jpg?height=372&width=849&top_left_y=1413&top_left_x=101)

Pressure roller: Two types of pressure rollers are available along with the machine. One is flat roller and the other is grooved one, grooved roller is having grooves of $3 \mathrm{~mm}, 4$ $\mathrm{mm}, 5 \mathrm{~mm}$ and 6 mm widths as shown in Fig 3.

## Fig 3

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_03_07_bfdfb33c8fd9dd5542bcg-4.jpg?height=314&width=606&top_left_y=2016&top_left_x=214)

PRESSURE ROLLERS

Latch: It holds the horn rigid by when pressure roller is functioning at the time of closing the seam.
Internal and External locks (Fig 4) can be made by adjusting the horn and changing the pressure rollers on the seam closing machine.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_03_07_bfdfb33c8fd9dd5542bcg-4.jpg?height=310&width=856&top_left_y=656&top_left_x=1011)

If the seam to be made on the outside of the object, adjust the flat or plain face of the horn on the upper side, and provide suitable grooved pressure roller in the carriage.

If the seam is to be made from inside of the object, adjust the suitable groove on the horn upper side and provide flat pressure roller in carriage as shown in Fig 5.

## Edge preparation

Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to

- explain the necessity of edge preparation
- describe the edge preparation for butt and fillet welds.

Necessity of edge preparation: Joints are prepared to weld metals at less cost. The preparation of edges are also necessary prior to welding in order to obtain the required strength to the joint. The following factors are to be taken into consideration for the edge preparation.

- The welding process like SMAW, oxy-acetylene welds, $\mathrm{Co}_{2}$ electro-slag etc.
- The type of metal to be joined, (i.e) mild steel, stainless steel, alumininum, cast iron etc.
- The thickness of metal to be joined.
- The type of weld (groove and fillet weld)
- Economic factors

The square butt weld is the most economical to use, since this weld requires no chamfering, provided satisfactory strength is attained. The joints have to be beveled when the parts to be welded are thick so that the root of the joints have to be made accessible for welding in order to obtain the required strength.

In the interest of economy, bevel butt welds should be selected with minimum root opening and groove angles such that the amount of weld metal to be deposited is the smallest. "J" and "U" butt joints may be used to further minimise weld metal when the savings are sufficient to justify the more difficult and costly chamfering operations. The "J" joint is usually used in fillet welds.
A root gap is recommended since the spacing allows the shrinking weld to draw the plates freely together in the butt joint. Thus, it is possible to reduce weld cracking and minimise distortion and increase penetration, by providing a root gap for some welded joints.
Method of edge preparation: The joining edges may be prepared for welding by any one of the methods mentioned below.

- Flame cutting
- Machine tool cutting
- Machine grinding or hand grinding
- Filing


## Types of edge preparation and setup

Different preparation generally used in arc welding are shown in Fig 1 below.

## Surface cleaning

Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to

- importance of cleaning
- describe the cleaning method

Every joint must be cleaned before welding to obtain a sound weld.

Importance of cleaning: The basic requirement of any welding process is to clean the joining edges before welding. The joining edges of surface may have oil, paint, grease, rust, moisture, scale or any other foreign matter. If these contaminants are not removed the weld will become porous, brittle and weak. The success of welding depends largely on the conditions of the surface to be joined before welding. The oil, grease, paints and moisture of the sheets to be welded will give out gases while heated by arc or flame and these gases will get into the molten metal. They will come out of the metal when the molten metal cools to form the bead and create small pin holes on the surface of the bead. This is known as porosity and it weakens the joint.

Methods of cleaning: Chemical cleaning includes washing the joining surface with solvents of diluted hydrochloric acid to remove oil, grease, paint etc (Fig 1)
