## Safety precaution in shielded metal arc welding and oxy-acetylene welding and cutting

Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to

- safety apparels and accessories used in arc welding
- safety apparels and accessories to protect from burns and injuries.


## Non-fusion welding

This is a method of welding in which similar or dissimilar metals are joined together without melting the edges of the base metal by using a low melting point filler rod but without the application of pressure.

Example: Soldering, Brazing and Bronze welding.
During arc welding the welder is exposed to hazards such injury due to harmful rays (ultra violet and infra red rays)of the arc, burns due to excessive heat from the arc and contact with hot jobs, electric shock, toxic fumes, flying hot spatters and slag particles and objects falling on the feet.

The following safety apparels and accessories are used to protect the welder and other persons working near the welding area from the above mentioned hazards.
1 Safety apparels
a Leather apron
b Leather gloves
c Leather cape with sleeves
d Industrial safety shoes
2 a Hand screen
b Adjustable helmet
C Portable fire proof canvas screens

## 3 Chipping/grinding goggles

## 4 Respirator and exhaust ducting

The leather apron, gloves, cape with sleeves and leg gaurd Figs 1, 2, 3 and 4 are used to protect the body, hands, arms, neck and chest of the welder from the heat radiation and hot spatters from the arc and also from the hot slag particles flying from the weld joint during chipping off the solidified slag.

All the above safety apparels should not be loose while wearing them and suitable size has to be selected by the welder.

The industrial safety boot (Fig 5) is used to avoid slipping. injury to the toes and ankle of the foot. It also protects the welder from the electric shock as the sole of the shoe is specially made of shock resistant material.

Welding hand screens and helmet: These are used to protect the eyes and face of a welder from arc radiation and sparks during arc welding.

A hand screen is designed to hold in hand. (Fig 6)

A helmet screen is designed to wear on the head. (Fig 7)
Clear glasses are fitted on each side of the coloured glass to protect it from weld spatters. (Fig 8)

The helmet screen provides better protection and allows the welder to use his both hands freely.

Coloured (filter) glasses are made in various shades depending on the welding current ranges used. (Table 1)

Table 1
Recommendations of filter glasses for maual metal arc welding

| Shade No of <br> coloured glass | Range of welding <br> current in amperes |
| :--- | :---: |
| $8-9$ | Up to 100 |
| $10-11$ | 100 to 300 |
| $12-14$ | Above 300 |

Portable fire proof canvas screens. Fig 9 are used to protect the persons who work near the welding area from arc flashes

Plain goggles are used to protect the eyes while chipping the slag or grinding the job. (Fig10)

It is made of Bakelite frame fitted with clear glasses and an elastic band to hold it securely on the operator's head. It is designed for comfortable fit, proper ventilation and full protection from all sides.
Sometimes toxic fumes and heavy smoke may be liberated (given out) from the weld while welding non-ferrous alloys like brass etc. Use a respirator and use exhaust ducts and fans near the weld area to avoid inhaling the toxic fumes and smoke. (Fig11)

Inhaling toxic fumes will make the welder to become unconscious and fall on the hot welded job/ on the floor. This causes burns or injury.
