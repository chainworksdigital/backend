- Alternating current welding machine
- Direct current welding machine.

These may be further classified as DC machines and AC machines.

## DC machines

- Motor generator set
- Engine generator set
- Rectifier set


## AC machines

- Transformer sets

AC means alternating current. It changes or reverses its direction of flow of current 50 times per second, if it is 50 cycles/sec. (Fig 3)
DC means direct current. it flows steadily and constantly in one direction. (Fig 4)

Care and maintenance of arc welding machines and accessories

Every machine and accessory used for any useful purpose requires some care and maintenance to increase its usage for a long time. In the case of arc welding machines and accessories the following points are important.

## AC welding machines

Do not keep the machine in open air. In a AC welding generator do not put the starting switch on DELTA position
directly: keep the switch on star position first. Run it for a few seconds and then put the switch in DELTA position. Do not disconnect the cooling fan of a welding generator.

Maintain the cooling oil in the transformer welding set.
Periodically drain the cooling oil from the transformer and purify, and refill the transformer. Fix the input cables form the mains to the machine and the electrode and earth cable firmly. Replace the carbon brushes of the DC welding generator whenever necessary.

Do not clean any welding machine with water. The dust and other impurities are to be removed by compressed air only. Operate all control knobs and handles gently.

Avoid loose connections at the main fuses, starting switch, etc.,
Arc welding accessories: Ensure the welding and earth cables are of standard amperage. The cables are to be joined only by sockets. Use the right capacity electrode holder and earth clamp. Avoid temporary arrangements to join cables or to connect earth clamp with the table or job. Avoid direct contact of electrode-holder with work table or job or earth connections. For this, hang the electrode-holder on the insulated hanger of the welding table. Use a properly insulated electrode-holder. Avoid over running of the trolley wheel etc. on the welding or return cable. Avoid stray arcing on the work table or on the job.

## Arc welding accessories

Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to

- identify the arc welding accessories
- explain the function of each accessory.


## Arc welding accessories

Some very important items, used by a welder with an arc welding machine during the welding operation, are called arc welding accessories.

Electrode-holder (Fig 1)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_03_07_f51e82af5e434499376dg-2.jpg?height=538&width=861&top_left_y=1273&top_left_x=89)

It is a clamping device used to grip and manipulate the electrode during arc welding. It is made of copper/copper alloy for better electrical conductivity.

Partially or fully insulated holders are made in various sizes i.e. 200-300-500 amps.

The electrode-holder is connected to the welding machine by a welding cable.

## Earth clamp (Fig 2)

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_03_07_f51e82af5e434499376dg-2.jpg?height=420&width=850&top_left_y=2240&top_left_x=89)

It is used to connect the earth cable firmly to the job on welding table. It is also made of copper/copper alloys.
Screw or spring-loaded earth clamps are made in various sizes i.e. 200-300-500 amps. (Fig 3)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_03_07_f51e82af5e434499376dg-2.jpg?height=478&width=852&top_left_y=1223&top_left_x=1016)

## Welding cables/leads

These are used to carry the welding current from the welding machine to the work and back.

The lead from the welding machine to the electrode-holder is called electrode cable.
The lead from the work or job through the earth clamp to the welding machine is called earth (ground) cable.

Cables are made of super flexible rubber insulation, having fine copper wires and woven fabric reinforcing layers. (Fig 4)

Welding cables are made in various sizes (cross-sections) i.e. $300,400,600 \mathrm{amps}$ etc.

Loose joints or bad contacts cause overheating of the cables.

The same size welding cables must be used for the electrode and the job.
The cable connection must be made with suitable cable attachments (lugs). (Fig 5)

LUGS FOR WELDING LEADS
THE THREE SIZES WILL FIT CABLES FROM NO 6 TO 4/0. THEY MAY BE CONNECTED TO THE LEAD BY SOLDERING OR MECHANICAL CRIMPING

The length of the cable has considerable effect on the size to be used. (See Table1)

## High pressure oxy-acetylene welding equipment and accessories

Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to

- distinguish between the features of oxygen and acetylene gas cylinders
- compare the features of oxygen and acetylene gas regulators
- distinguish between the house-connectors used in oxygen and acetylene regulators.

Oxy-acetylene welding is a method of joining metals by heating them to the melting point using a mixture of oxygen and acetylene gases. (Fig 1)

## Oxygen gas cylinders

The oxygen required for gas welding is stored in bottleshaped cylinders. These cylinders are painted in black colour. (Fig 2) Oxygen cylinders can store gas to a capacity of $7 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ with the pressure ranging between 120 to $150 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$. Oxygen gas cylinder valves are right hand threaded.

## Dissolved acetylene cylinders

The acetylene gas used in gas welding is stored in steel bottles (cylinders) painted in maroon colour. The normal storing capacity of storing acetylene in dissolved state is $6 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ with the pressure ranging between $15-16 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$.

## Oxygen pressure regulator

This is used to reduce the oxygen cylinder gas pressure according to the required working pressure and to control
the flow of oxygen at a constant rate to the blowpipe. The threaded connections are right hand threaded. (Fig 3)

## Acetylene regulator

As with the case of oxygen regulator this also is used to reduce the cylinder gas pressure to the required working pressure and to control the flow of acetylene gas at a constant rate to the blowpipe. The threaded connections are left handed, for quickly identifying the acetylene regulator, a groove is cut at the corners of the nut. (Fig 4)

## Rubber hose-pipes and connections

These are used to carry gas from the regulator to the blowpipe. These are made of strong canvas rubber having good flexibility. Hosepipes which carry oxygen are black in colour and the acetylene hoses are of maroon colour (Fig 5)
Rubber hoses are connected to regulators with the help of unions. These unions are right hand threaded for oxygen and left hand threaded for acetylene. Acetylene hose unions have a groove cut on the corners. (Fig 6)

Fig 6
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_03_07_f51e82af5e434499376dg-4.jpg?height=424&width=457&top_left_y=1710&top_left_x=1205)

At the blowpipe end of the rubber hoses-protectors are fitted. The hose protectors are in the shape of a connecting union and have a non-return disc fitted inside to protect from flashback and backfire during welding. (Fig 7)

Blowpipe and nozzle: Blowpipe are used to control and mix the oxygen and acetylene gases to the required proportion. (Fig 8)
A set of interchangeable nozzles/tips of different sizes is available to produce smaller bigger flames. (Fig 9)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_03_07_f51e82af5e434499376dg-5.jpg?height=1737&width=863&top_left_y=157&top_left_x=184)

The size of the nozzle varies according to the thickness of the plates to be welded. (Table 1)

Table 1

| Plate <br> thickness | Nozzle size |
| :---: | :---: |
| $m m$ | Number |
| 0.8 | 1 |
| 1.2 | 2 |
| 1.6 | 3 |
| 2.4 | 5 |
| 3.0 | 7 |
| 4.0 | 10 |
| 5.0 | 13 |
| 6.0 | 18 |
| 8.0 | 25 |
| 10.0 | 35 |
| 12.0 | 45 |
| 19.0 | 55 |
| 25.0 | 70 |
| Over 25.0 | 90 |

## Gas welding hand tools

Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to

- identify and name the hand tools used by a welder
- state their uses.

The following are the details of different hand tools used by a welder.

## Double ended spanner

A double ended spanner is shown in Fig 1 and 1a. It is made of forged chrome vanadium steel. It is used to loosen or tighten nuts, bolts with hexagonal or square heads. The size of the spanner is marked on it as shown in Fig 1. In welding practice the spanners are used to fix the regulator onto the gas cylinder valves, hose connector and protector to the regulator and blow pipe, fix the cable lugs to the arc welding machine output terminals, etc.

Do not use any size of hammer; use the correct size of spanner to avoid damage to the nut/bolt head,

## Cylinder Key

A cylinder key is shown in Fig 2. It is used to open or close the gas cylinder valve socket to permit or stop the gas flow from the cylinder to the regulator.

Always use correct size key to avoid damage to the square rod used to operate the valve. The key must always be left on the valve socket-itself so that the gas flow can be stopped immediately in case of flash back/back fire.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_03_07_f51e82af5e434499376dg-6.jpg?height=1603&width=861&top_left_y=157&top_left_x=89)

## Nozzle or tip cleaner

## Cleaning the tip

All welding torch tips are made of copper. They can be damaged by the slightest rough handling. Dropping, tapping or chopping with the tip on the work may damage the tip beyond repair.

## Tip cleaner

A Special tip cleaner is supplied with the torch container. For each tip there is a kind of drill and a smooth file. (Fig 3)
Before cleaning the tip, select the correct drill and move it, without turning, up and down through the tip. (Fig 4)

The smooth file is then used to clean the surface of the tip Fig 5 . While cleaning, leave the oxygen valve partly open to blow out the dust.

## Spark lighter

The spark lighter, as illustrated in Figs 6 \& 7 is used for igniting the torch. While welding, form the habit of always
employing a spark lighter to light a torch. Never use matches. The use of matches for this purpose is very dangerous because the puff of the flame produced by the ignition of the acetylene flowing from the tip is likely to burn your hand.

## Chipping hammer

The chipping hammer (Fig 8) Is used to remove the slag which covers the deposited weld bead. It is made of medium carbon steel with a mild steel handle. It is provided with a chisel edge on one end and a point on the other end for chipping off slag in any position.

Fig 3
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_03_07_f51e82af5e434499376dg-6.jpg?height=550&width=391&top_left_y=693&top_left_x=1258)

Fig 4
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_03_07_f51e82af5e434499376dg-6.jpg?height=1311&width=859&top_left_y=1314&top_left_x=1008)

Care should be taken to maintain the sharp chisel edge and the point for effective chipping of slag.

## Carbon steel wire brush

A carbon steel wire brush is shown in Fig 9. It is used for

- Cleaning the work surface from rust, oxide and other dirt etc. prior to welding.
- Cleaning the inter bead weld deposits after chipping off the slag
- General cleaning of the weldment.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_03_07_f51e82af5e434499376dg-7.jpg?height=233&width=604&top_left_y=329&top_left_x=1120)

A stainless steel wire brush is used for cleaning a nonferrous and stainless steel welded joint.

It is made of bunch of steel wires fitted in three to five rows on a wooden piece with handle. The wires are hardened and tempered for long life and to ensure good cleaning action.

Tongs: Figs10 \& 11 show a pair of tongs used to hold hot work pieces and to hold the job in position.
