## Importance of welding in Industry

Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to

- realise and state the importance of welding in industry
- state the advantages of welding over other methods of joining metals.

In engineering industry, joining of different type of metals is necessary to make various components/parts having different shapes. Various type of parts are joined by bolting or riveting if thickness of metal is more. Example: Iron bridges, steam boilers, roof trusses, etc. For joining thin sheets ( 2 mm thick and below) sheet metal joints are used. Example: Tin containers, oil drums, buckets, funnels, hoppers etc, also thin sheets can be joined by soldering and brazing.

But very heavy thick plates used in heavy industries are not joined by riveting or bolting as the joints will not be able to withstand heavy loads. Also the cost of production will be more. So many special materials for special applications like space ships, atomic power generation, thin walled containers for storing chemicals. etc have been developed in the recent years. They can be joined easily at a lower cost with good joint strength by using welding. A welded joint is the strongest joint of all the other types of joints, the efficiency of a welded joint is $100 \%$ whereas the efficiency of other types of joints are less than $70 \%$.

So all industries are using welding for the CG \& M of various structures.

Advantages of welding over methods of joining metals

Welding method: Welding is metal joining method in which the joining edges are heated and fused together to form permanent (homogeneous) bond/joint.

Comparison between welding and other metal joining methods

Riveting, assembling with bolt, seaming, soldering and brazing all result in temporary joints. Welding is the only method to join metals permanently.
The temporary joints can be separated if:

- the head of the rivet is cut
- nut of the bolt is unscrewed
- hook of the seam is opened
- more heat is given than that required for soldering and brazing.


## Advantages of welding

Welding is superior to other metal joining methods because it:

- is a permanent pressure tight joint
- occupies less space
- gives more economy of material
- has less weight
- withstands high temperature and pressure equal to joined material
- can be done quickly
- gives no colour change to joints

It is the strongest joint and any type of metal of any thickness can be joined.
